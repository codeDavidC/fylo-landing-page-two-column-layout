## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design.

I practiced how to use CSS Grid and positioning elements with start, center and end.


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code:

```html
<form action="">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Your e-mail"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
</form>
```
```css
  input[type=text] {
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: none;
    font-family: var(--body-font);
    padding-left: .5rem;
    padding-top: .2rem;
    padding-bottom: .2rem;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
  }

  input[type=submit] {
    background-color: var(--pink);
    border: none;
    color: white;
    font-family: var(--body-font);
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-weight: 600;
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 8px 30px;
    cursor: pointer;
    position: absolute;
    right: -10px;
  }
```
